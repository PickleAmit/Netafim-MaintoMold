# MaintyMold

MaintyMold is a comprehensive error management system developed for Netafim. Built using React for the client-side and C# .NET Entity Framework for the backend, this project aims to streamline the process of error tracking by facilitating the opening, closing, and information retrieval of all errors.

## Important
